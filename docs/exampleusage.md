# Example Usage

The first thing to discuss when talking about interacting with the
dispatcher service is data format.

## The Parts

There are several parts to this code as it encompasses
integrating several python libraries together.

 * [PeeWee](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/)
 * [CherryPy](https://cherrypy.org/)
 * [Celery](http://www.celeryproject.org/)

For each major library we have integration points in
specific modules to handle configuration of each library.

### PeeWee

The configuration of PeeWee is pulled from an INI file parsed
from an environment variable or command line option. The
configuration in the file is a database
[connection url](http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/database.html#connecting-using-a-database-url).

 * [Dispatcher PeeWee Model](Dispatcher PeeWee Model)
 * [Dispatcher Config Parser](Dispatcher Config Parser)

### CherryPy

The CherryPy configuration has two entrypoints for use. The
WSGI interface and the embedded server through the main
method.

 * [Dispatcher Main Method](pacifica.dispatcher.__main__)
 * [Dispatcher WSGI API](pacifica.dispatcher.wsgi)
 * [Dispatcher CherryPy Objects](pacifica.dispatcher.rest)

### Celery

The Celery tasks are located in their own module and have
an entrypoint from the CherryPy REST objects. The tasks
save state into a PeeWee database that is also accessed
in the CherryPy REST objects.

 * [Dispatcher Tasks](pacifica.dispatcher.tasks)

## Start Up Process

The default way to start up this service is with a shared
SQLite database. The database must be located in the
current working directory of both the celery workers and
the CherryPy web server. The messaging system in
[Travis](https://github.com/pacifica/pacifica-dispatcher/blob/master/.travis.yml)
and
[Appveyor](https://github.com/pacifica/pacifica-dispatcher/blob/master/appveyor.yml)
is redis, however the default is rabbitmq.

There are three commands needed to start up the services.
Perform these steps in three separate terminals.

 1. `docker-compose up rabbit`
 2. `celery -A pacifica.dispatcher.tasks worker -l info`
 3. `python -m pacifica.dispatcher

To test working system run the following in bash:

 1. `UUID=$(curl http://127.0.0.1:8050/dispatch/add/2/2)`
 2. `curl http://127.0.0.1:8050/status/$UUID`
